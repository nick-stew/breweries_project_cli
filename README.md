# breweries_project_cli

Breweries Project CLI

Welcome to my CLI project. This project is about breweries.  In this app you will choose a state and it will show a list of breweries in that state.  Then you can choose a brewery that you want to learn more about.

Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

gem 'breweries_project_cli'

And then execute:

$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

$ gem install breweries_project_cli

Usage
When prompted type in the FULL STATE NAME you are looking to search in. Then select the number of the brewery you wish to learn more about. If you want to search again when prompted type yes if not type no.

Development
After checking out the repo, run bin/setup to install dependencies. Then, run rake spec to run the tests. You can also run bin/console for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run bundle exec rake install. To release a new version, update the version number in version.rb, and then run bundle exec rake release, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the .gem file to rubygems.org.
